      <h1>SoftUni Kid Ninjas</h1>
      <p>
        The Software University experienced ninjas do their best to teach the kids that want to go the same way as they did.
        The main idea in this school is to improve their skills through games.
      </p>

      <p>
         All kids need to improve their logical thinking and imagination so they can master nindjucus a lot faster.
      </p>

      <p>
         The mission of the Software University for kid ninjas is to provide affordable and quality education,so they can acquire the necessary skills
         and knowledge with which to make a confident first steps in the modern ninja programming world.
      </p>

      <h3>The Path for the Kids is Divided in Four Schools</h3>
      <p>
        The first school focuses on building core competencies and skills necessary for children to continue their studies in subsequent
         modules of their path to become real ninjas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second school teachers will improve their skills in HTML and CSS so they can become real HTML or CSS ninja one day when they grow up.
        After this school they can choose if they want to go to the PHP or JavsScript schools.
      </p>
      <p>
        The JavaScript masters are very harsh and they teach the kids to solve their problems face to face.
        They need to be very tough and fearless.
        After they graduate from the school they can take the long path to become real JavaScript ninja masters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The location of the PHP school is unknown.The masters take the kids somewhere and teach them the secret ninjutsus only they know.
        The kids need to be very smart and agile.They learn how to do their training in the shadows each day.
        After graduation they may go to the other PHP schools with unknown masters and locations to become real PsHP ninjas one day.
